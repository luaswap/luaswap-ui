        Mercurial Finance Mercurial is building DeFiâ€™s first dynamic vaults for stable assets on Solana, providing the
        technical tools for users to easily deposit, swap and mint stable assets. <br />
        <br />
        Innovations <br />
        Mercurial will be
        introducing several key new technical innovations, including on-chain algorithms to regulate the flow of assets
        and dynamic fees that tap on the market and price data to assist LPs in optimizing performance. We will also be
        developing a unique pricing curve that will be the first to combine high efficiency, multi-token support, and
        generalizability for all types of token sets. <br />
        <br />
        Maximizing Capital Utlilization <br />
        Mercurial vaults will dynamically
        utilize assets for a wide range of use cases, like low slippage swaps, lending, flash loans, and external
        third-party decentralized protocols. To increase pegged assets availability on Solana, we will allow the
        creation of synthetics, like mUSD or mBTC, which can be added to our vaults to improve liquidity for other
        stables and facilitate interaction with other third-party decentralized protocols. <br />
        <br />
        Starting with a vault for the
        most common stables, for example, USDC, USDT, wUSDC, and wDAI, we will be facilitating low slippage swaps with
        dynamic fees. Features will be added as key technical and ecosystem pieces become available on Solana, i.e.
        inter-program composability, price oracles, etc.
